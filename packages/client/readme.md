# web client

## MVP 

A web app that allows you to open files on your local computer and view the .stl/.obj files,then add to projects and add meta data about it.

All data will be stored in local storage a json object.

The reference context also needs to be saved with the object so it can be reloaded later without going through the browsers dialog to open it again, 
this would be rather tedious for lots of files.

## Getting Started


This app uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) to run, build and develop it


```js
npm run dev // runs the dev server

npm run serve // runs the preview server

npm run build // builds the app to ./build folder

npm run test // runs the cypress test framework.

```
